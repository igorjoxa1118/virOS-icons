Installation
============

**************
***  LXQt  ***
**************
 1. Put the extracted folder in '~/.local/share/icons/'.

 2. Update the icon cache with the following command in terminal (Qt uses GTK icon cache and you need `gtk-update-icon-cache`):

     gtk-update-icon-cache ~/.local/share/icons/Plataro

 3. select it from Configuration Center → Appearance → Icons Theme.

Also, make sure that this box is checked: Appearance → Icons Theme → Colorize icons based on widget style (palette)

If you update the set, don't forget to recreate the icon cache by using the above-mentioned command.

*************
***  KDE  ***
*************
Put the extracted folder in '~/.local/share/icons/' (create the last folder "icons" if it doesn't exist; here '~' is your home). Then, select Plataro in System Settings → Icons and click Apply.

If you update the set, don't forget to recreate the icon cache by choosing another icon set in System Settings → Icons, selecting Plataro again and clicking Apply.
